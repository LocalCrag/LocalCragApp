## License
By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the repositoryâ€™s existing license. See [LICENSE](https://github.com/LocalCrag/LocalCragApp/blob/main/LICENSE) for details.

## Getting Started
- Pick any open issue youâ€™d like to work on. Feel free to suggest new ideas by opening an issue.
- If an issue already exists but you have additional insights or ideas, comment on it before starting work.

- Ensure consistency with the project's established patterns and conventions.

## Commit & PR Guidelines
- Use **Conventional Commits** for PR titles. Individual commits donâ€™t need to follow this format since the PR will be squashed.
- The PR title must follow Conventional Commit format. The pipeline will enforce this.
- Use only **standard Conventional Commit types** (e.g., `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `refactor`, etc.).
- Scopes are flexible, but if a label exists for the scope, prefer using it.
- Keep PRs focused: avoid mixing unrelated changes.

## Additional Best Practices
- Keep PR descriptions clear and concise. Explain what the change does and why itâ€™s needed.
- When updating dependencies, ensure compatibility and provide a summary of changes.
